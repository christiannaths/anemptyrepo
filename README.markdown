To clone this repository to your desktop, try running this from terminal:

    git clone git@github.com:christiannaths/anemptyrepo.git ~/Desktop/anemptyrepo

The command you are running is the "git clone" command, which accepts
at least one parameter: the URI to the remote location where the
repository is found. In this example it's on Github at <code>git@github.com:christiannaths/anemptyrepo.git</code>

The second (optional) parameter is the local directory in which
you want to store the repository. So in this case it's on your
desktop in a folder with named with the ID of the gist: <code>~/Desktop/anemptyrepo</code>

so it's broken up like this:

    [git clone] [URI] [/path/to/cone/repo/into]


You should be able to navigate to your desktop and see the folder which now
contains the repo. In terminal run <code>cd ~/Desktop/anemptyrepo</code>
