To clone this gist to your desktop, try running this from terminal:

    git clone git@gist.github.com:1279303.git ~/Desktop/gist-1279303

The command you are running is the "git clone" command, which accepts
at least one parameter: the URI to the remote location where the
repository is found. In this example it's on Github at "git@gist.github.com:1279303.git"

The second (optional) parameter is the local directory in which
you want to store the repository. So in this case it's on your
desktop in a folder with named with the ID of the gist: "~/Desktop/gist-1279303"

so it's broken up like this:

    [git clone] [URI] [/path/to/cone/repo/into]


You should be able to navigate to your desktop and see the folder which now
contains the repo. In terminal run "cd ~/Desktop/gist-1279303"
